# Ramachandran_plot
Using biopython &amp; matplotlib to draw different ramachandran_plots. The phi psi angle are from AMBER forcefield simulation result &amp; CPPTRAJ analyse

**Biopython**, **Numpy** and **Matplotlib** is needed. The environment is python **3.7**.

## Rama_PTR.png
This is an example file.

## Rama_extract.py
Use this program to extract the psi-phi angles from **one** pdb file (several models)(and only the first one angle - this will be fixed soon) and save the angles values to a txt file.

## Rama_extract.py
Use this program to extract the phi-psi angles from **several** pdb files (also have the features showed below).

## Rama_plot.py
Use this program to draw the ramachandram plot with the txt file with angle values.
